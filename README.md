# Product Reviews Analysis with NLP

This project focuses on analyzing customer product reviews using Natural Language Processing techniques. It includes sentiment classification, category clustering, and review summarization using transformer-based models.

---

## Overview

The goal is to extract useful insights from customer reviews and present them in a clear, structured way. The workflow includes:

- Preprocessing and cleaning review text  
- Fine-tuning BERT for sentiment classification  
- Clustering products into broader categories using embeddings  
- Summarizing reviews for top and worst products using BART and GPT models  

---

## Features

- **Sentiment Classification**: Trained a BERT model to classify reviews into positive, neutral, and negative.
- **Product Clustering**: Used sentence embeddings and clustering methods to group similar products.
- **Summarization**: Generated summaries for each category using BART and GPT-3.5, highlighting top products and common complaints.

## Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, TensorFlow
- Hugging Face Transformers (BERT, BART)
- SentenceTransformers
- Scikit-learn
- OpenAI API (GPT-3.5)
